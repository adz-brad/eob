## Can you have glowing skin before your Wedding?

Whilst there’s no guarantee you will be blemish free on your wedding day, there’s A LOT you can do to ensure you have great looking complexion on your big day. Your wedding day is one of the most exciting and memorable days of your life. Planning this magical day can be both enjoyable and a little stressful. One worry on every brides’ mind is how their skin is going to look on that day. Reducing stress and maintaining a healthy lifestyle (nutritious food and getting enough rest) is helpful; however tailored [skin treatments](https://www.essenceofbeauty.ca/treatments/ "Skin Treatments") can assist you in getting noticeable results.

Essence of Beauty Skin Care Clinic is here to assist you with your skincare journey. The Clinic is founded on holistic beliefs and the continuous journey between inner peace and outer beauty. In demonstration of these beliefs we bring you the highest standards of products, treatments, and services. For our beautiful brides to be, we have created a countdown guide to get your skin glowing for your big day!

## When to start

With all eyes on you, not to mention photos that will live on, you’ll want to have a flawless face free of dry skin, blemishes, and other skin impurities. First things first, stop buying hundreds of products thinking they’ll give you the perfect glow and go see a skin specialist. You can actually save yourself a lot of time and money by making sure what you’re putting on your skin is going to deliver the results you need.

The best time to visit your skin specialist is 6-8 months before the wedding, thus allowing your specialist to evaluate your skin and decide on the best course of action. If you have a skin condition such as [acne](https://www.essenceofbeauty.ca/holistic-acne-clinic-ottawa/ "Holistic Acne Clinic"), this time frame is very important. Many people with acne have suffered with it for a number of years and it cannot be turned around in just a few weeks. Specialized treatments are needed, and a specific diet and lifestyle should also be considered, because the changes that need to be made can take time. If you don’t have a particular skin problem, usually a series of treatments is recommended to give your skin a boost, to get it in tip top condition. Afterwards you will be given a maintenance programme to follow.

## See a skin therapist

If you have mild to moderate acne, you would typically need at least 6 months to up to a year (or longer) of using an integrated system and a clinical [treatment approach](https://www.essenceofbeauty.ca/acne-treatment-ottawa/ "Acne Treatments"). Severe acne can take 12 months or longer to remedy and some individuals may need additional support.

If you are treating the occasional pimple, then at least 3 months of professional guidance can help you learn how to keep pimples at bay and get your skin looking fresh and “glowing” before your wedding day.

If you have dry, dull and sallow skin at times that needs a bit of TLC before your big day, then 2 months of professional guidance can help you achieve smooth, brighter and a more youthful looking complexion.

Next, we move to personalize your treatment and blend formula products to suit your skins needs.
