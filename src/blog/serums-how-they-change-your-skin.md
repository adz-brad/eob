If you want to see the change in your skin, whether it is to beat your acne, slow the process of aging in your skin or fight your redness, you need to use serums.

## Serum and its multiple benefits

Serums are designed to repair the skin at a cellular level and act on a wide range of skin health factors at the same time. Its soft, light texture rapidly penetrates the skin’s surface to prepare it for daily care. The many active ingredients in the serum work to amplify the effects of your normal skincare regime by enhancing the radiance, firmness, and suppleness of your skin. The face serum should be incorporated daily to give your skin the boost it needs. It also works effectively for those one-off skin imperfections and can be used to moisturize the delicate eye area prone to dark circles.

If you have aged, damaged, acne, scarred, or sun damaged skin, a serum is your best choice to reduce the visible impacts on your skin.

## How are serums different from moisturizers?

The molecules in serums are smaller than those in your regular moisturizer; thus they penetrate deeper into the skin and give better results. A moisturizer has larger molecules, therefore, it only works on the first layer.

While serums deposit highly concentrated active nutrients, vitamins and minerals, which are essential for treating various skin conditions, moisturizers provide moisture and hydration to the skin.

## Choosing the right serum for your skin

Whether you’re blessed with a good complexion or have problematic skin, the sheer variety that you have in serums can be a conundrum for even a beauty junkie. To ensure that you find one that will suit your skin, begin by picking a serum as per your skin type — dry, oily, combination or sensitive. There is no such thing as the best face serum for everyone. You can determine the right product for you according to your age and needs.

The best place to start is with a skin care professional who can recommend the best option for you. Sure, you could skip this and go to your local supermarket, but, it’s doubtful you’ll find any brand with enough of what you need to do anything more than (at best) provide you with antioxidant protection.

Come in for a consultation! You’ll quickly see that I have lots of great tools for treatments and great product lines with safe, quality ingredients to help you in a non-invasive and non-irritating way.
