Microneedling on it's own is an effective, proven treatment for reducing acne and trauma scarring as well as improving photo damaged skin and the added application of topical growth factors can help to supercharge this process!

## What is Microneedling?

Microneedling is the process of safely puncturing the skin at a controlled depth, stimulating a cascade of resulting effects including promoting collagen formation. This process helps to treat things like:

- Acne scarring
- Trauma scars
- Photo damaged skin
- Redness & skin irritation

The post-procedure skin-tightening and collagen boosting effects of microneedling have been proven to continue for 5 to 7 years, making it a positive, valuable treatment option. And since microneedling is minimally invasive, doesn’t cause significant wounding to the skin, and isn’t light-based, most people can safely undergo microneedling therapy with minimal risk of long-term adverse effects.


## What Are Growth Factors?

Growth factors are naturally occuring substances such as vitamins or hormones that stimulate growth in living skin cells, boosting skin hydration, elasticity and firmness among other things. The clinical use of growth factors is proven to improve the appearance of:

- Fine lines, wrinkles & age spots
- Skin brightness & hydration
- Skin lesions & scars
- Texture & pore size


## What Are The Benefits of Microneedling With Growth Factors?

The results are proven - adding growth factors to the microneedling process has already been proven to demonstrate the following:

- A noticeable decrease in fine lines, wrinkles and age spots in over 98% of patients after just 5 treatments
- Noticeable improvements in over 87% of sensitive skin patients after just 2 treatments
- Improvements in over 92% of patients with uneven skin texture and enlarged pores after just 3 treatments!


## Who Can Growth Factor Microneedling Help?

Anyone! Because of the non-invasive nature of the ACS pen device used to administer microneedling treatments as well as the use of naturally-derived growth factor serums, growth factor microneedling is virtuall painless and can be used to treat those with even the most sensitive skin. While it is common to feel a slight vibration on the skin during treatment in addition to some noticeable redness occuring immediately after the procedure, any irritation should subside by the following day. In fact, many patients notice an immediate glow in the skin after just one treatment!
