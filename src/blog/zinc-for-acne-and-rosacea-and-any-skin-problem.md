When you think of vitamins and minerals that can benefit your skin, it’s unlikely that zinc ranks too highly on the list – but did you know it’s essential for cell growth and renewal?
Zinc is one of the many essential nutrients that your body needs. It primarily protects your immune system by fighting off harmful bacteria.

While zinc is thought to help keep you healthy by reducing illnesses, it’s been studied for other medical concerns, too. This includes acne (acne vulgaris, cystic or hormonal acne). Zinc is actually one of the most widely studied forms of acne and rosacea treatment. Zinc also has the ability to inhibit bacteria growth in sebaceous glands. And although more research is needed, studies have found the mineral to significantly decrease papules and cysts when taken orally and when applied topically.

## Just how effective is zinc at treating acne, really?

Zinc is a high-performance ingredient that helps to address redness, irritation, and inflammation caused by conditions like acne, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis.

The absence of the mineral may be the cause of breakouts. Zinc is necessary for collagen synthesis, and when deficient, the keratin in the skin can be more ‘sticky,’ resulting in more clogged pores. A lot of people with acne may find supplementation helpful to decrease acne breakouts.

Zinc should be included in any healthy daily regimen. If you want to add zinc to your acne-fighting routine, you need to select the best form of zinc.

## There is a long list of reasons why zinc for acne and rosacea is an effective treatment:

- Zinc is an important anti-inflammatory for the skin. Inflammation is one of the root causes of acne.
- Zinc assists with the metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids which also helps reduce inflammation.
- Zinc is naturally antibacterial which reduces the effect bacteria has on the skin.
- Zinc helps break down substance P, the nerve chemical that causes sebum production when the body is stressed.
- Zinc is responsible for transporting vitamin A for acne prone skin, an antiacne nutrient, from the liver.
- Zinc aids apoptosis, programmed cell death which is a natural part of your skin renewing itself. If apoptosis is delayed, as in the case of zinc deficiency, skin cells stick together instead of dying and sloughing off like they should, which leads to clogged pores
- Zinc reduces keratinocyte activation. Keratinocytes are cells that produce keratin, a tough protein that binds skin cells together. Too much keratin prevents cells from separating and leads to blocked pores, as is the case in acne. By reducing keratin, zinc helps to keep skin pores open.

## Zinc From Food

People with acne often have low levels of zinc in their system. Approximately 30 – 45 mg per day is the therapeutic dose of elemental zinc for acne, but this isn’t necessarily easy to reach through diet alone. Unfortunately, the more pollution we encounter, the more zinc we lose, and the fruits and vegetables we grow for food no longer contain this essential mineral.

## Zinc Supplements for Acne

As an antioxidant mineral, zinc may help protect your skin against the harmful effects of free radicals, substances that can damage cells and accelerate the aging process. Zinc sulfate, a form of zinc, has been used as an oral treatment for acne and other skin conditions. Zinc sulfate may also help reduce the inflammatory symptoms of rosacea. Zinc helps improve most cases of acne. When zinc is taken in combination with other products for acne, it just might be the missing link you need for understanding how to treat body acne. We recommend choosing the formulations with the highest bioavailability such as zinc sulfate by Good State.
