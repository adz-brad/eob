Your skin plays a vital role in protecting your body, so it’s important to take steps to promote skin health. What’s going on internally is reflected in our skin. **Here are few things you can do to give your skin that healthy glow we all crave:**

## Eat less Inflammatory foods

The biggest culprit are inflammatory foods like dairy, eggs, gluten, sugar, and alcohol. If you’re having issues with your skin, those are foods to experiment with eliminating. Try taking them out for several months and see if that has any effect.

## Eat proper food to get healthy skin

Food provides life to your skin. Everything you eat in your everyday life contributes to healthy skin

Fresh Vegetables are filled with vitamins and minerals and are good sources of phytochemicals that protect the body from disease and aging. This includes power foods such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, brussel sprouts , and sweet potatoes .  These nutrients are crucial for radiant skin.
Fresh Fruits are filled with vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals that protect the body. This include power foods such as wild blueberries, lemons, apples, bananas, mangos, and watermelons.  Each of these fruits have a wide variety of health benefits.

## Drink lots of pure water with lemon

Water is needed for hydration, detoxification, and circulation of body fluids.

## Get at Least 8 Hours of Sleep

Getting the proper amount of sleep allows your skin to rest and regenerate. Being constantly sleep deprived can cause stress on your skin and existing skin conditions to worsen. This is why it is important to get use to sleeping on a consistent sleep cycle.

## Personalize your routine

Cleansing, toning, moisturising and the occasional scrub are recommended for everyone but that doesn’t mean that everyone’s skin responds to the routine in the same way. When it comes to your skin, yes, there are some rules that you need to follow blindly – such as taking off your makeup before you go to bed, moisturising after you cleanse and applying sunscreen but how much and how often depends on your skin type. Therefore, invest enough time into figuring out what products and regimes work best for you and then follow them routinely. There’s a certain comfort in routine as they say, and no one will appreciate it more than your skin.

## Don’t strip your skin

One of the biggest mistakes I see people making is over washing and scrubbing their skin. I recommend just cleansing once a day (if not oily), at night to remove any makeup and pollution from the skin. Then simply rinse with the water in the morning.

## Try a Clinical Treatment
