It goes without saying that our skin is a reflection of our environment. What we put on our skin and in our bodies has a direct effect on how clear, young, and radiant our skin looks. And while there are definitely various factors that can affect our skin’s health, one of the easiest ways to change your skin for the better is simply ditching chemical-laden makeup and using non-toxic [mineral makeup](https://www.essenceofbeauty.ca/mineral-makeup/ "Mineral Makeup") instead will do wonders for your skin as well as your overall health.

## Here are 5 reasons to make the switch

Minerals support your skincare efforts by sitting on the skin without penetrating into pores or fine lines, making it an excellent option for rosacea, sensitive, and acneic skin types.

### Gentler on sensitive skin

Minerals are sourced from the earth and are free of harmful toxins and chemicals that cause irritation. Instead, they feature natural ingredients that nourish, soothe, and protect.

### Outstanding Performance

Minerals deliver richly-pigmented shades and promote a flawless complexion that will endure the day, working as hard as you do!

### Do Your Part to Go Green

Mineral makeup is an eco-friendly alternative to most drugstore cosmetics. Because of the naturally-sourced ingredients, you can also minimize your carbon footprint!

Apart from mineral makeup giving the skin a beautiful, natural-looking finish, Osmosis skincare is also 100% cruelty-free and made with rich vitamins that work to protect your skin such as zinc oxide, moringa seed oil, and the unique goji berry blend – just to name a few!

The best part, in my opinion, is that mineral makeup is suitable for all skin types. I strongly recommend mineral makeup for sensitive skin types suffering with conditions such as rosacea and eczema, as well as acne-prone skin types that often break out from using makeup. It’s also a great option for those of you who prefer to wear minimal makeup day-to-day.
