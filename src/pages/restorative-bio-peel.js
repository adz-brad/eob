By Penetrating the skin makes fine wounds activate dermal cells by stimulating the skin for 36 to 72 hours, causing peeling of waste and giving oxygen and nutrients to the skin. Through the natural exfoliating effect skin restores its original health and peels off the skin cells.

This will be determined by several factors, including your age, the quality of your skin, and the extent of your damage. The therapy gives amazing results after the first treatment, but in most situations, a series of 4 treatments are needed, especially if we are targeting any pigmentation or acne scars. </p>
