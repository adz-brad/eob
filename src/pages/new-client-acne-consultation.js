                            An acne assessment begins with a questionnaire that will capture your relevant  medical history. We will be taking pictures of the effective areas so that we can identify signs of improvement during future visits.

                            We recommend herbs and supplements to help re-balance the body from the inside out. We educate you on the lifestyle habits and choices that aggravate acne- like food, birth control pills (they do not always help acne), medications, prescriptions, and stress. Please be prepared to make a commitment to lifestyle changes. If you do, you will see results.  Acne treatment is a long term commitment of weekly or bi-weekly.
