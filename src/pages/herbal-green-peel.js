                            All of us are probably well acquainted with the theory everywhere marketed in recent years that one of the most popular approaches to skin brightening and renewal has been through the application to the skin of synthetics and acids of various strengths. The acids themselves are very inexpensive and so can be very appealing means for an attractive return for practitioners and for clients seeking a quick and brighter look to the skin.
                        </p>
                        <p className="my-1">
                            At Essence of Beauty, however, we're aware that the most advanced science regarding skincare indicates that there are healthier, more holistic and more successful approaches to skin renewal that do not rely on chemicals or the damaging effects of acids. In fact, the best science in the field tells us that in practice, the frequent use of acids sets up a problematic domino effect that is not only difficult for clients to break but results in the opposite of their intended purpose – that is, acids weaken the cellular structure of the skin thereby speeding the aging process.
                        </p>
                        <p className="my-1">
                            We doubt you want to accelerate the speed at which your skin ages and we at Essence of Beauty most certainly don’t want that for you either. What we want to offer you are treatments and products that support the principal philosophy of our spa – that here is where Health meets Beauty.

                             We have found for many, three treatments spaced a month to six weeks a part produce the best results. This provides the correct time frame for skin cells to rejuvenate and then respond optimally to the next treatment, producing a completely fresh, glowing, rejuvenated skin.  Metabolism is activated, microcirculation as well as the interlocking of skin layers is improved. This in turn results in the skin receiving more oxygen and nutrients. The connective tissue fibers (collagenous and elastic fibers) are activated and metabolic wastes wicked away.

                            Small herb particles polish the surface layers of the skin creating a slight burning sensation similar to a mild sunburn and reddened skin. Following the treatment, you are given clear instructions regarding the use of special products and post treatment skin care. Within three to four days, the skin begins peeling away revealing a new, refreshed skin.

                        The natural herbs help to stimulate circulation, as pores open and the skin optimally absorb ingredients.  Green Peel® Fresh Up lets the skin radiate with new freshness. Cells are vitalised and skin quality is sustainably improved-the perfect treatment for tired appearing skin. The Fresh Up is perfect against premature skin aging and loss of elasticity-even or especially when the skin does not show any visible signs of aging yet.
