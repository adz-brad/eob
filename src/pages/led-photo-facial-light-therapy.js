                    Our LED device is designed to curve comfortably around your face, emitting different LED wavelengths that penetrate the skinâ€™s deeper layers to target a range of concerns. Completely pain free, it can work to accelerate wound healing, boost collagen and even out skin tone. Effective on all skin type. Our treatments are the most advanced light treatments available, and we can adapt each session to suit your specific needs. With regular maintenance treatments, our LED facials can result in a noticeable improvement to your skin health.
